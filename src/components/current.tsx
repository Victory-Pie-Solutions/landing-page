The previous week, we presented our Across module catalogue to customers, spotlighting the initial product and illustrating its advancements from both technical and business perspectives. We received valuable feedback from customers, providing insights into how we can enhance and further develop in subsequent phases. We are eager to unveil our final product in the upcoming pitch.

          We are currently working on a project under Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz as part of our studies. Our aim is to contribute to an initiative led by our university known as the Across Alliance. This alliance consists of ten European universities that collectively form the European cross border University Across. The goal is to facilitate successful cross-border exchange and collaboration within different regions in Europe. The initiative seeks to deepen cooperation among European universities situated across borders. The focus of this cooperation will be on crucial cross-border issues such as development and economic challenges, comparative law and public administration, education, natural resource management, tourism, migrations transportation, culture, and the preservation of cross-border cultural heritage.
